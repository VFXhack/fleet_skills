# HANDOFF — for the next Claude Code agent

You are continuing a **`grill-with-docs`** (domain-modeling) effort on the `fleet-skills` repo: the
bounded context for Andy's CG → AI video pipeline. **Read `CONTEXT.md` (the glossary / source of
truth) and `adr/0001`–`0022` before doing anything.** Then skim **`PIPELINE.md`** (the canon flowchart:
main Shot flow, the supervisor-only Asset Production sub-flow, and the system/provenance view — it
visualizes exactly what this handoff describes). Then read the memory `andy-working-style.md`.

## Who / how to behave
- **Andy** — solo CG→AI operator, ADHD, learning to code. **One question at a time**, concrete next
  steps, and when language is fuzzy give **2–3 concrete options + a recommendation**, then let him
  choose (`AskUserQuestion` with previews works well). Keep momentum; no sprawling tangents.
- He's a **VFX domain expert** — defer to him on VFX meaning, but **challenge contradictions** (he
  will override his own prior "LOCKED" calls; surface the trade-off first).
- **As decisions land: update `CONTEXT.md` inline and write an ADR** in `/adr` (number sequentially,
  follow 0001's format) for any non-obvious, hard-to-reverse decision. Never leave decisions only in chat.

## Session 12 (2026-07-02) — the Override store (ADR 0023) + the Cast engine: built, PROVEN, APPROVED
The Session-11 "START HERE" is DONE: grilled the Override store (one AskUserQuestion round; Andy
picked the recommended option), landed it, then built + proved Cast. **Andy drove the full card
himself and approved — `cast` + `override` are prime time** (his one gotcha: the tools need the
venv activated or a `.venv\Scripts\` prefix; his one question: `land` — confirmed fixture-only
theater for farm+Roustabout, refuses non-fleet_test DSNs).
- **ADR-0023 — the Override store is a `shot_overrides` table** (settles the ADR-0020 Open): one row
  per overridden attribute, TWO forms (param `param_key`+`param_value` / binding `role`+`asset_id`,
  CHECK-enforced, two partial unique indexes). **Keyed by stable codes** (`sequence_id, shot_code,
  run_type, param_key|role`) — NEVER `look_run_id`, which rebuild-fresh Hoist (ADR 0022) would
  orphan. `run_type` = the Look Run's stable identity across re-Hoists. The operator surface is a
  standalone **`override` CLI** (`set|list|clear`) — chosen over `cast --set` sugar (Andy was AFK;
  recommended option applied, veto welcome). CONTEXT updated (status → v0.9; the header had lagged
  at v0.8/Session 7 — Sessions 10–11 canon folded in).
- **Migration `0005_shot_overrides.sql`** (applied to `fleet_test`; CHECK + both partial uniques
  verified): `shot_overrides` + **`runs.cast_from` jsonb** — the Cast provenance breadcrumb
  `{sequence_code, look_version, ord}` (ADR 0020 §7 "which Look version made this?"), codes not
  uuids for the same rebuild-fresh reason. **Prod `fleet` on Mckenna is still at migration 0003** —
  0004+0005 must be applied there before any of this touches prod.
- **`cast` CLI built + PROVEN vs `fleet_test`** (`fleet/cast.py`, repository fns, entry points
  `cast` + `override`). Semantics: clone each Look Run into a real Run (params = Look ⊕ overrides,
  override wins), auto-bind shared-content (binding override re-points to the Shot's own Asset),
  **demand per-shot inputs** (`--input Role='asset name'`; ALL missing Roles listed in one round,
  like hoist's class gate), and shared-recipe Roles bind **convergently**: the producer Look Run is
  cloned too, and once its per-Shot take lands + publishes, **re-running the same `cast` binds it**
  (idempotent — never duplicates, only completes). One txn; `--dry-run`; casting at a NEW
  look_version creates a fresh Run generation (forward-only, ADR 0013).
- **Hoist now clears the look-dev Shot's now-redundant overrides** (the deferred ADR-0020 §6
  clause): surgical — only attributes present in the lifted params/roles per run_type; PROVEN
  (010's `cfg` cleared, its non-hoisted `denoise` survived, sibling 020's rows untouched).
- **Proven end-to-end** (fixture `hoist_demo`, new `land <shot>` cmd simulates farm + Roustabout
  no-look auto-publish for cast control-pass Runs; seed now registers Shot 020's plate+dialog):
  seed → overrides → hoist (clearing ✓) → cast 020 (demand gate ✓, cfg=4.0 honored ✓, Character-Sheet
  → sequence Asset ✓, Depth-Pass waiting ✓) → land → re-cast (binds own p001 ✓) → re-cast (no-op ✓)
  → binding override + re-Hoist → re-cast at look_version 2 (NEW generation, BOTH overrides honored
  — the shield ✓) → `override clear` (follows the Sequence again ✓).
- **New: `db/apply_migrations.py`** — the prod-capable migration runner (the fixtures are
  fleet_test-only by design): prints target + per-migration applied/MISSING status (probed by
  marker relations), applies nothing without `--yes`, applies missing ones in ledger order.
  Status mode proven vs fleet_test. Built because the auto-mode permission classifier (correctly)
  refused agent-side prod DB access — **prod applies are run by Andy's own hand**.
- **Open:** apply 0004+0005 to prod `fleet` (Andy runs `python -m db.apply_migrations --yes`
  with no FLEET_DB_DSN set — was queued at end of Session 12, confirm it happened); write-tools
  refusing a prod DSN during testing (Session-11 hardening idea, still open); restyle
  `create-project`/`add-shot`/`add-sequence` (optional); per-shot `--input` re-demanded every
  generation (fine for now — could persist as declared inputs later if it annoys).

**Single next action (START HERE): build the Submitter ingest/expand/dispatch slice.** Cast is
approved and creates authored Runs, but nothing yet validates/expands `spec` into Versions
(ADR 0016) or dispatches to a Runner — that's the front half that makes a cast Shot actually
render (and lets the real Roustabout, not the fixture's `land`, complete the convergence).
Grill the ingest shape first per the loop; check prod is at migration 0005 before any prod writes.

## Session 11 (2026-06-30 → 07-02) — the Look rename + the Hoist engine: built, PROVEN, styled
Two sittings (the first ended before writing its handoff; this entry covers both). The Session-10
"START HERE" (the Hoist half of Hoist/Instantiate) is DONE and Andy-approved; **Cast is next**.
- **ADR-0021 — "Sequence Pattern" renamed the Sequence Look.** Pattern tested too abstract; the Look
  IS what you look-dev. Tables now `sequence_look_runs`/`sequence_look_bindings`, `sequences.
  pattern_version` → `look_version`; migration rewritten as `0004_sequences_and_look.sql` (the
  pattern-named file deleted; `fleet_test` recreated on the new schema). Verb pair: **Hoist** up /
  **Cast** down (Cast replaces *Instantiate*; foundry sense — stamp from the master mold).
- **ADR-0022 — Hoist is publish-driven.** It never lifts a bare Version: the anchor is a **Publish**
  of the look-dev Shot — the **latest** by default, `--publish N` to re-anchor (the client-zigzag
  case: notes match an older approved take). From the anchor: Publish → source Version → Run, plus
  transitively the Runs behind **shared-recipe** inputs. To Hoist an unpublished take, `promote`
  first (that *records* the approval). Rejected for now: `--version` promote-and-hoist sugar (blurs
  Hoist ≠ promote).
- **`hoist` CLI built + PROVEN vs `fleet_test`** (`fleet/hoist.py`, repository fns, entry point
  `hoist`). Proven behaviors: the classification gate (every discovered Role demands a `--class`,
  the deliberate class-born-at-Hoist moment); **one-round discovery** (unclassified publish-backed
  inputs descend for *discovery only*, so round one lists ALL Roles incl. nested ones like the
  control-pass `Source`; the lift still follows only classified shared-recipe edges); rebuild-fresh
  + `look_version` bump; sequence-Asset **reuse** on re-Hoist (idempotent); `--publish` re-anchor;
  clean refusals (no Publish → "promote first"; bad p-number). One txn; rollback on any failure.
- **Fixture `db/fixtures/hoist_demo.py`** (`seed|inspect|reset|dsn`): a look-dev Shot exercising all
  3 sharing classes (control-pass depth ← plate → p001; seed-sweep with Character-Sheet Import +
  Depth-Pass pinned to p001 + Lipsync-Dialog; hero v003 → p002 = default anchor). `dsn` prints the
  fleet_test DSN **from config, ignoring `$FLEET_DB_DSN`** (a stale env var once echoed itself back
  through the old version); destructive ops PARSE the DSN and refuse `dbname != fleet_test`
  (substring check let a garbage value through). Leary has NO psql — this module is the test-DB
  driver there.
- **CLI styling (Andy-requested):** new dep **`rich`**; **`fleet/style.py`** pins the visual
  language — sharing classes color-pinned everywhere (shared-content **green**, shared-recipe
  **cyan**, per-shot **yellow**), codes bold, Publishes magenta, `die()` = red stderr errors.
  `hoist` plan = compact table; `inspect` = **grouped rows** (Andy picked over a wide table — long
  paths get their own line, nothing truncates at 80 cols). Binding displays sort by Role (fixes
  nondeterministic order — created_at ties, uuid tiebreak). Per-host venvs need `pip install -e .`
  (or `rich`) when they first run the CLIs.
- **Open:** the Override store (override-clearing still deferred, ADR 0020); write-tools refusing a
  prod DSN during testing (hardening idea from a near-miss); restyle `create-project`/`add-shot`/
  `add-sequence` to match (optional).

**Single next action (START HERE — Andy's call, end of Session 11): GRILL the Override store first,
then build Cast.** Cast must honor Shot Overrides, so settle the ADR-0020 open *where a Shot's
Overrides live* before writing code — when Shot 020 says "my CFG is 4.0, not the Sequence's 3.5",
is that (a) a new `shot_overrides` table, (b) a per-Shot config record/row, or (c) stamped into the
Cast-created Run itself? (Remember: an Override is a local value AND a shield against later Hoists —
option (c) alone can't shield.) One question at a time, 2–3 options + a recommendation, ADR when it
lands. THEN **build the Cast tool** — the downward half (ADR 0020 §6 / 0021): at Run-submit, clone
each Look Run into a real Run for a sibling Shot — auto-bind shared-content, **re-run** shared-recipe
Look Runs for that Shot's own content (existing version→publish→bind spine + the Roustabout's no-look
auto-publish), demand the per-shot inputs it still owes, honor Shot Overrides. Prove vs `fleet_test`
with `hoist_demo` (seed → hoist → cast a second Shot, e.g. `SANDBOX_EP01_SALEM_020`), per the
build-and-prove loop.

## Session 10 (2026-06-29) — Sequence Pattern model (ADR 0020) + structure tools; fleet landed
Grill + build session. Modeled how a Sequence shares state, then built the structure-layer tools on it.
Committed `8e30e74` on `main`, pushed, and synced all four hosts. (memory: `cli-build-and-prove-loop`)
- **Process locked — the build-and-prove loop:** every CLI tool = I write it → self-prove vs `fleet_test`
  (NEVER prod) → hand Andy a "how to drive it" card → he tests → revise → only on his explicit approval is
  it "prime time". Prove each tool in isolation before composing. (memory `cli-build-and-prove-loop`.)
- **ADR-0020 (the headline): a Sequence carries shared state via live inheritance + a Sequence Pattern.**
  - **3-way sharing class** (the rule for what propagates): **shared-content** (one artifact, all shots →
    `assets.scope='sequence'`), **shared-recipe** (same settings, content regenerated per shot, e.g. a
    depth-pass = a `control-pass` Run auto-published no-look by Roustabout → a prototype Run), **per-shot**
    (differs per shot, e.g. audio → `assets.scope='shot'`).
  - **Sequence Pattern** = a set of **prototype Runs** (named "Pattern", NOT Template/Recipe/Spec — taken;
    NOT Blueprint — Unreal collision). A Shot **instantiates** it; **Hoist** lifts an approved **look-dev
    (Target) Shot**'s recipe UP, **selectively by class** (class is born at Hoist). **Override** = a Shot's
    local value + a shield against later Sequence changes. Hoist ≠ promote (up-the-structure vs across-a-gate).
  - **Hygiene:** reverses ADR-0003 (no Sequence level) + 0008/0011 (no structure in DB) for Sequence
    *config* only; added forward **"Amended by ADR 0020"** markers to 0003/0008/0011 so CONTEXT.md stays the
    single live truth (Andy's call: mark history, don't delete the reasoning). CONTEXT.md updated inline.
- **Schema — migration `0004` (proven on `fleet_test`):** `sequences`, `sequence_pattern_runs`,
  `sequence_pattern_bindings` (3-way source CHECK: `asset_id` XOR `produced_by_pattern_run_id` XOR neither,
  matching the class), `assets.scope += 'sequence'` + `assets.sequence_code`. All CHECK behaviors verified.
- **Tools (proven vs `fleet_test`, Andy-approved):** `add-shot` (stamps the ADR-0003 shot tree, ensures the
  Sequence config row on first shot, `--lookdev`) and `add-sequence` (manage title + (re)designate look-dev,
  validating the shot folder exists). New: `fleet/naming.py` (`JOB_EP_SEQ[_SHOT]` codes; `_` separates so
  parts can't contain `_`), `scaffold.scaffold_shot_tree`, repository sequence fns. Entry points added.
- **Ops — fleet landed + synced to `8e30e74`:** Huxley/Ramdass/Watts `git pull`ed clean. **Mckenna's
  `~/fleet_skills` was NOT a git clone** (the Session-9 sync gap) — a stale non-git file copy; **fresh-cloned
  it** (old copy preserved at `~/fleet_skills.bak`). `~/ao-tools` on Mckenna is a SEPARATE unrelated repo —
  not fleet_skills. Host-map memory corrected.
- **Open (ADR-0020, settle when building Hoist/Instantiate):** where a Shot's overrides live; confirm
  `sequence_code` form (`JOB_EP_SEQ`); optional Hoist provenance breadcrumb; whether `ord` suffices to
  schedule the per-Shot chain or `produced_by_pattern_run_id` should drive a topo order.

**Single next action (START HERE): build the Hoist / Instantiate engine** — where the Sequence Pattern
comes alive. Two halves: **Instantiate** (a non-target Shot's submit clones the Pattern's prototype Runs →
binds shared-content, re-runs shared-recipe for its own content via the existing version→publish→bind spine
+ Roustabout no-look, demands per-shot inputs) and **Hoist** (supervisor classifies the look-dev Shot's
recipe by sharing class, lifts it into the Pattern, clears the now-redundant overrides, bumps
`pattern_version`). Lives in the **Submitter** (resolve Shot-over-Sequence inheritance, freeze per Version
per ADR-0007). Prove against `fleet_test` per the loop. Note: the structure layer (`create-project` →
`add-shot` → `add-sequence`) is done + proven; this is the behavior layer on top.

## Session 9 (2026-06-28) — INFRA: test DB harness; store cleaned; ADR-0003 confirmed canon
Ops/infra session. No CONTEXT/ADR text changes; set up repeatable testing so future work is cheap.
- **Prod store cleaned:** deleted the Session-8 `DEMO/SPINE` smoke rows (project+run+version+event,
  one txn, child-first; `events` has no FK so removed by `subject_id`). All 8 tables at 0 — pristine.
- **Separate test DB `fleet_test` (the headline):** ALL testing now runs against `fleet_test`, never
  prod `fleet`. Granted the `fleet` role `CREATEDB` (one-time superuser on Mckenna), created
  `fleet_test`, applied migrations `0001`–`0003`. New committed harness: **`db/test_db.sh`**
  (`setup|reset|info|dsn|psql`) + **`db/reset_test.sql`** (blunt `TRUNCATE … RESTART IDENTITY
  CASCADE`); recipe in `db/README.md` → "Test database". Point tools at it with
  `export FLEET_DB_DSN="$(bash db/test_db.sh dsn)"`. Destructive ops **refuse any non-`fleet_test`
  DSN** (verified). This is the fix for "it took ages to find/clear test rows": isolation by
  construction, blunt teardown, committed connection recipe (no re-discovery). (memory: `fleet-db-live`)
- **ADR-0003 confirmed CANON (reconciliation gap RESOLVED):** Andy's call — the canonical on-disk
  tree is ADR-0003; the real legacy `AI_Renders` layout (AWA, Centenario) is legacy, not the model.
  New jobs get the ADR-0003 tree via `create-project`. (Migrating existing legacy jobs = open, later.)
- **Fixed:** the local (Watts/dev) `~/.fleet/config.toml` had a STALE DB password → `fleet` auth
  failed; corrected to match Mckenna's authoritative DSN. Rotating the role pw must update EVERY host.
- **Also:** reverted an unrequested `settings.json` change a statusline subagent slipped in
  (`permissions.defaultMode=auto` + `skipAutoPermissionPrompt=true`) — approval gates restored.

- **`create-project` PROVEN live (2026-06-28):** ran `fleet.cli --client TEST --job SANDBOX` against
  `fleet_test` (dev box, `FLEET_DB_DSN` → tailnet `/fleet_test`). Verified: `projects` row inserted;
  ADR-0003 tree scaffolded on `\\huxley\io_common\projects\TEST\SANDBOX` (`_ops/{config,jobs,logs,
  scripts}`, `assets/`, `editorial/`, `EP01/deliverables/`, `CONTEXT.md`, `manifest.json`); the thin
  manifest's `db_project_id` == the DB row UUID (ADR-0006 round-trip ✅); a re-run **refused** to
  clobber (exit 1, no partial write). Then torn down (DB reset + folder removed) — recreate in seconds.
- **Tailnet pg_hba broadened (2026-06-28):** Session-8's rule allowed only the `fleet` *database* over
  Tailscale, so dev-box clients couldn't reach `fleet_test`. Appended `host all fleet 100.64.0.0/10
  scram-sha-256` + reload → the `fleet` *role* now reaches any DB over the tailnet (test DBs included).
- **Sync gap to check next time:** Mckenna's `~/fleet_skills` is NOT a git clone (`git pull` fails) and
  its config has no `[paths].projects_root` — so the committed `db/test_db.sh` isn't deployed there and
  Mckenna can't run dev-box tools as-is. Fine for now (helper runs from the dev box); fix if a
  Mckenna-side run is needed (e.g. the multi-process spine test wants the worker on Mckenna).

**Single next action (START HERE): build the Import/publish CLI** — the smallest tool that puts
outside-made material (a hand-rendered take, a Nuke comp, a manual upscale) into the system as a
**Publish** (ADR 0005 Import path). `submitter/writes.py:promote()` already does Version→Publish + the
`p###` allocation + `PublishRecorded`; what's missing is the **Import half** (register an external
artifact as a Version, or a human-facing CLI around register+promote) and a persisted publish tag/role.
Test it against `fleet_test` (recreate a `TEST/SANDBOX` fixture via `create-project`, `reset` between
runs). Then a **thin read CLI** to view the store. (Andy reprioritized these AHEAD of the Submitter
ingest slice — value sooner, less machinery.)

## Session 8 (2026-06-27) — INFRA: provenance DB is LIVE; fleet synced; spine PROVEN
First non-grilling session — stood up real infra and proved the code spine against it. No
CONTEXT/ADR changes (ops only). The recurring "stand up Postgres on Mckenna" action is DONE.
- **Postgres on Mckenna is up** (PG 17 cluster `17/main`). Created db `fleet` + role `fleet`
  (LOGIN, scram); applied migrations **0001–0003** (8 tables + `runs.spec`); tailnet exposure
  (`listen_addresses = localhost,100.108.34.23`, pg_hba `100.64.0.0/10` scram); wrote
  `~/.fleet/config.toml`. Idempotent setup script lived at `/tmp/fleet_setup.sh` on Mckenna.
  DSN password is in that config (chmod 600), NOT in git/memory. (memory: `fleet-db-live`)
- **Spine PROVEN end-to-end live:** seeded a `control-pass` run + 1 landed version, ran
  `roustabout.worker` + `submitter.emit_demo version <id>`. Full chain fired: emit → outbox
  INSERT+NOTIFY → worker drain → take-landed + run-complete barrier (1/1) + auto-publish
  eligibility (control-pass ∧ count==1 → eligible) → event `done`. psycopg 3.3.4 installed via
  `pip install --user --break-system-packages` (Mckenna has no `python3-venv`).
- **Fleet synced (ADR 0009):** pushed Leary's 2 Session-7 commits to origin, then `git clone`
  on **Huxley / Ramdass / Watts** — all at `3ed805b`. Future updates = `git pull`. Per-host SSH
  logins DIFFER (memory: `fleet-hosts` — `andy`@mckenna/huxley, `andyorloff`@ramdass, `ajorl`@watts;
  Mckenna sudo is sudo-rs needing a real TTY; Watts shell is cmd.exe).
- **Open (cheap):** the spine proof left a `DEMO`/`SPINE` smoke-test project+run+version+event in
  the DB — delete those 4 rows (cascade from the project) for a clean store before real writes.

**Single next action (START HERE): build the Submitter ingest/dispatch slice.** The emit + write
paths exist (`submitter/events.py`, `writes.py`); what's missing is the front half: ingest a Submit
→ insert the `runs` row + `bindings` (roles) → VALIDATE `spec` against the Template's declared knobs
→ EXPAND `spec` into N `versions` (each with `delta` + `frozen_submission`, ADR 0016/0007) → dispatch
to a Runner. Then a take lands → `record_landed_take` (already built) emits `VersionRecorded` → the
proven Roustabout spine takes over. Clear the DEMO rows first. Infra is ready and live — no setup tax.

## Session 7 (2026-06-26) — `control-pass` generalizes `depth-pass` (do NOT re-litigate)
Andy's call: depth isn't special — it's one flavor of a whole family of control/structure inputs.
- **ADR 0017** — replaced the `depth-pass` `run.type` with **`control-pass`**: depth, canny, openpose,
  matte are **one run.type** (one Roustabout flow), the **flavor is a Spell** named by `spec.method`
  (`depthcrafter-bw20`, `canny`, `openpose`, `matte-*`, …), output bound in a **per-kind Role**
  (Depth-Pass / Canny / OpenPose / Matte). Scope = control/structure maps only; **audio + creative assets
  out**. Amends 0014 (enum) + 0016 (spec row). No schema change (open text type; `runs.spec` exists).
- **Where "what a run does" lives (Andy's question, settled):** `run.type` = dispatch shape (code/DB enum);
  `spec` = this run's variables incl. `method` (DB, on the Run); **the Spell in the Spellbook = the actual
  craft** (the ComfyUI graph / ffmpeg comp). `spec.method` is the seam pointing a Run at its Spell. For gen
  runs a **Template** (Spellbook) also holds the prompt pattern + knob declarations the Submitter validates.
- **Touched (control-pass):** ADR 0017 (new); 0014/0016/0011 enum notes; CONTEXT (`Run`, `Seed Sweep`, new
  `Control Pass` entry replacing `Depth Pass`, Role values, open-Qs); PIPELINE (DEPTH node→Control-Pass,
  bind edge, View 1b text+table, writes table); `skills/depth-pass/SKILL.md`→v0.3 (now the depth family of
  control-pass; Run logs `type: control-pass` + `spec.method`).

### Then: grilled the Roustabout `FLOWS` to completion (§OPEN 5 — done)
- **ADR 0018 — Roustabout FLOWS.** Two tiers on `VersionRecorded`: **per-take** (proxy/thumbnail + log) and
  a **per-run completion barrier** ("N of N landed", a deterministic count it *reads* from the spec
  expansion, ADR 0016) → contact-sheet if >1 take, one "run done" notify, **auto-publish**. **Auto-publish
  bounded:** only `type ∈ {control-pass, upscale, comp}` ∧ `version_count == 1` (creative sweeps never —
  picking a take is judgment); single-output comp/up-res internal gate goes auto, human check moves to
  QC/client-gate. **Wired chains:** the Roustabout may auto-submit new Runs ONLY for judgment-free
  `(trigger + Role/tag) → fully-pinned Run recipe` transitions (default Spell, fixed params); a short
  explicit `CHAINS` registry, not a workflow graph. **New event `PublishRecorded`** (Submitter emits on
  every publish insert — auto or human promote) drives chains.
- **ADR 0019 — Event delivery.** `LISTEN/NOTIFY` as a wakeup over a **durable `events` outbox** (row
  written same-txn as the version/publish insert); Roustabout drains pending on startup → nothing lost;
  **at-least-once → idempotent handlers**. Rejected pure NOTIFY (lossy) and an external broker (premature).
- **Touched (FLOWS):** ADR 0018 + 0019 (new); CONTEXT (Roustabout entry rewritten, Submitter entry, new
  `Orchestration events` entry, status→v0.8, open-Qs); PIPELINE (ROUST node, event seam + `events` outbox
  node, promote/gate, writes table +`PublishRecorded` row, open-items→resolved).

### Then: built the Roustabout spine (the chosen implementation start)
- **`db/migrations/0003_events_outbox.sql`** — the durable `events` outbox table (ADR 0019):
  `type ∈ {VersionRecorded,PublishRecorded}`, `subject_id`, `payload jsonb`, `status`, `attempts`,
  `UNIQUE(type,subject_id)` for emission idempotency, partial `events_pending_idx`. No trigger — the
  Submitter does INSERT + NOTIFY in its app txn.
- **`roustabout/`** — the thin Python worker (psycopg 3.3, Python 3.13): `config.py` (DSN per db/README +
  `EVENT_CHANNEL='fleet_events'`), `worker.py` (LISTEN/NOTIFY + 30s poll backstop; claim with
  `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`; savepoint per handler; retry→`error` after 5; startup backlog drain),
  `handlers.py` (dispatch; **REAL**: run-completion barrier + auto-publish eligibility + take log;
  **STUB**: proxy/contact-sheet/notify, and auto-publish-write/chains which must go via the Submitter),
  README + requirements.
- **Verified (no live DB):** `py_compile` + import clean; eligibility truth-table + dispatch routing pass.
  NOT run against Postgres (Mckenna DB may not be stood up; don't mutate the real store without Andy).

### Then: built the Submitter emit path (chosen next slice)
- **`submitter/`** — `events.py`: `emit_version_recorded(conn, version_id)` + `emit_publish_recorded(conn,
  publish_id, role=…)` — INSERT into `events` (ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING) + `pg_notify('fleet_events', …)`,
  **inside the caller's txn** (transactional outbox); both enrich payload via a join (run_id/shot_code/
  run_type, +role/tag for publishes). `config.py` (DSN + channel, duplicated from roustabout — unify into a
  shared `fleet` module when a 3rd consumer lands; noted as cleanup). `emit_demo.py` — opt-in CLI
  (`python -m submitter.emit_demo version|publish <id>`) to smoke-test the spine end-to-end. README.
- **Verified (no live DB):** py_compile + imports clean; `Json` adapter resolves; `emit_demo --help` OK;
  channel name `fleet_events` consistent across migration + both config.py.
- **Not built:** the write path that CALLS emit (`record_landed_take`, `promote` w/ p### allocation), the
  rest of the Submitter (ingest/expand/dispatch), and a persisted publish tag/role for chain matching.

### Then: built the Submitter write path (`submitter/writes.py`)
- `record_landed_take(conn, version_id, address)` — UPDATE `versions.address` + `emit_version_recorded`,
  one txn (ADR 0013); idempotent.
- `promote(conn, version_id, path=…, role=…)` — per-shot advisory lock → allocate next `p###`
  (`COALESCE(MAX(number),0)+1`, writer-allocated per ADR 0008) → INSERT publish → `emit_publish_recorded`;
  returns `(publish_id, number)`. This is the call-site for BOTH a human gate and the Roustabout's
  auto-publish. Verified py_compile/import (no live DB).

**Single next action (START HERE):** the code spine is complete (Submitter emit+write path → outbox →
Roustabout drain → handlers). The only thing left for a **real end-to-end proof is live infra**, which
needs Andy's hands: **stand up Postgres on Mckenna, apply migrations `0001`–`0003`**, then in two terminals
run `python -m roustabout.worker` and `python -m submitter.emit_demo version <id>` against a seeded
run/version row — watch the barrier/eligibility/stub-handler logs fire. After that proves out: wire the
first `CHAINS` entry (Hero → depth `control-pass`) and/or build the Submitter ingest/dispatch slice. The
deferred **Branch 6** (real control-pass method Spells) remains available as an independent track.

## Session 6 (2026-06-26) — PIPELINE.md hardened to canon (do NOT re-litigate)
A `grill-with-docs` pass pressure-tested `PIPELINE.md` against the UL + ADRs, fixed 7 issues, then
modeled the per-run-type spec; all landed in PIPELINE / CONTEXT / ADRs:
- **ADR 0013** — `VersionRecorded` fires only after a take's output lands; the **Submitter** writes
  `versions.address` on render completion (Flamenco callback / sync Runner return) and emits then. "Write
  the pointer back" moved **off** the Roustabout (now no-poll, no-pointer-back). Amends 0010/0012.
- **ADR 0014** — `run.type` is ONE rich enum and the single Roustabout dispatch key
  {seed-sweep, prompt-variation, xy-plot, refine, comp, upscale, depth-pass}, orthogonal to
  `versions.stage` (render/upscale/comp = storage bucket). Refines 0005/0011.
- **ADR 0015** — Shot code includes the Episode token: `JOB_EP_SEQ_SHOT` (`AWA_EP01_SALEM_010`), because
  Sequence names recur across Episodes. Amends 0003; implies a rename in the legacy migration + runner scripts.
- **ADR 0016** — per-`run.type` **spec** contract: each type declares its variables (xy-plot axes =
  knob + explicit values, N=points; seed/prompt/comp/upscale/depth specs); all inputs via **bindings**
  (new roles `Source`, `Comp-Input`); new `runs.spec` column (migration `0002_run_spec.sql`). The
  Submitter validates `spec` against the Template's knobs, then expands it into Versions.
- **UL sharpening (CONTEXT only):** Template "function" = workflow-type/**mode** (=`runs.mode`); Block
  "function" = prompt-**purpose**. Plate/Driver & Lipsync-Dialog are Publish XOR Import; `depthXbw`
  normalized to Depth-Pass/depth-pass; **Lipsync-Dialog** added to View 1 + the Asset sub-flow + note-triage.
- DDL (`0001_initial_schema.sql`) already had `address` + the `stage` CHECK; only comments were updated.

**Single next action (START HERE):** grill the **Roustabout `FLOWS[run.type]`** (see §OPEN 5) — for each of
the 7 types, what fires on `VersionRecorded`: proxy/thumbnail (always?), contact-sheet (for grid types
xy-plot/seed-sweep?), auto-publish (depth-pass → its depth Publish; upscale?), chain next stage? Then pick
the event mechanism (Postgres `LISTEN/NOTIFY` vs a queue). **Now unblocked** by ADR 0016 — the Roustabout
wakes with a typed, validated `spec` and a known version count. Two tiny non-blocking cleanups noted this
session: align `skills/depth-pass/SKILL.md`'s `depthXbw20` filename token with the `depthcrafter-bw20`
variant Spell; and `job_code` is only unique per-client (so `shot_code` is per-Job unique, not global).

## DONE — Session 1 grilling is COMPLETE (do NOT re-litigate; all in CONTEXT.md + ADRs, committed)
Every architectural branch is resolved. Committed in `7b0e7a6` (ADRs 0002–0010 + CONTEXT v0.3 + schemas)
and a follow-up commit (depth-pass skill).
- **Project store** on **Huxley**; `base_path` platform-neutral + per-machine resolution. (ADR 0002)
- **Project structure** shot-centric, Client→Job→Episode→Sequence→Shot, two-tier `assets/`. (ADR 0003)
- **Reconciled the prior UL handoff**; adopted Generation→**Version**. (ADR 0004)
- **Artifact / versioning / provenance**: Submit→Run→Version(`v###`)→Publish(`p###`)→Delivery(`v#`);
  Import; Lineage pointers; gated namespaces; Role-on-binding. (ADR 0005)
- **Thin Manifest** = identity + logical `base_path` + `db_project_id`; provenance DB-only. (ADR 0006)
- **Recipe storage hybrid**: authoring recipe on the Run + frozen Submission Prompt per Version (JSONB). (ADR 0007)
- **Provenance core = thin Postgres on Mckenna** (own UL); `projects` table = the project index;
  `db_project_id` = row UUID; DSN in Fleet config; Notion → one-way view; Video Generations log migrates in. (ADR 0008)
- **Spellbook = `spellbook/` folder in THIS repo** (beside `skills/`); distributed by the Git remote
  (`github.com/VFXhack/fleet_skills`) via clone + `git pull`; Notion demoted. (ADR 0009)
- **Orchestration = two floors** (ADR 0010, amended by **0012**): **Ringmaster** (agent, later; Hermes
  plays it) over **Roustabout** (deterministic worker, now — a thin Python worker), joined to the atomic
  Submitter at the `VersionRecorded` event. **Griptape demoted** from "the conductor" to a Ringmaster-floor
  candidate (vs the Claude Agent SDK); it is **not** the Roustabout.
- **depth-pass Skill** rewritten: hardened **spine** (Comfy on Huxley → depth **Publish** in
  `<Shot>/publishes/`, Run → Postgres via Submitter); concrete recipes are **variant Spells**
  (`depthcrafter-anyline-combo`, `depthcrafter-bw20`; `seedance-color2depth` deprecated).

## OPEN — next session is IMPLEMENTATION, not domain grilling
The domain model is settled; the remaining work is building it. Priority order:
1. **Postgres provenance core (START HERE).** Author the schema DDL — 7 UL-named tables (`projects`,
   `runs`, `versions`, `publishes`, `deliveries`, `assets`, `bindings`), **JSONB frozen-submission** on
   `versions`, **FK pointer edges** for lineage, per-gate counters. **Stand up Postgres on Mckenna.**
2. **`create-project` rewrite (stale).** Must: scaffold the ADR-0003 tree; insert a `projects` row and
   write the UUID into the Manifest's `db_project_id`; write the thin manifest (ADR 0006 schema).
3. **Spellbook migration.** Move Spells/Templates from Notion + the project `CLAUDE.md` recipes into
   `spellbook/`; pin the **depth-pass variant Spell** params (DepthCrafter `s5g2p0w110`, the ffmpeg
   B&W comp @20%, Anyline settings) while doing it.
4. **Notion**: one-way DB→Notion sync + a Notion→Postgres migration of the Video Generations log.
5. **Roustabout `FLOWS` — DESIGN DONE (ADR 0018/0019, Session 7); now IMPLEMENT.** The dispatch model is
   settled (two-tier reactions, bounded auto-publish, wired chains, `PublishRecorded`, `LISTEN/NOTIFY` +
   durable `events` outbox). Build it: the **`events` outbox** (`0003_events_outbox.sql`) + the thin Python
   worker (LISTEN + drain + idempotent handlers), the `FLOWS[run.type]` + `CHAINS` tables in code, and the
   first chain (Hero → depth `control-pass`). Ringmaster tool choice (Griptape vs Claude SDK) can still wait.

## RECONCILIATION GAP discovered this session (important for `create-project`)
The **real on-disk projects do NOT match ADR 0003.** Live layout (e.g. `W:\Projects\WBTV\AWA\`,
`W:\Projects\HMVFX\Centenario\`) uses `AI_Renders\<SHOT>\`, `AI_Frames\`, `plates\`, `renders\`,
`comps\`, `deliverables\`, `logs\`, `docs\`, per-shot `run_*.ps1` scripts + an `awa.toml` + per-project
`CLAUDE.md`. Takes are **flat `<SHOT>_<variant>_<params>.mp4` + a sidecar `.json` recipe** (e.g.
`CTO_99_99_berniniref_seed777.json`), not `v###` in a `versions/` tree. So ADR-0003 is **aspirational**;
`create-project` either scaffolds the new tree for *new* jobs or a migration path is needed for existing
ones. Surface this to Andy before building `create-project`. (`W:` is the per-machine mount of the
project store; comfy-runner toolchain lives at `W:\Projects\ComfyUI_Tools`.)

## Micro to-confirms (cheap, fold in when relevant)
- ~~Episode token in the Shot code~~ — **resolved:** included, `JOB_EP_SEQ_SHOT` (ADR 0015).
- ~~Block-candidate term / Template "function"~~ — **resolved:** candidate = *variant*; Template fn = mode,
  Block fn = purpose (CONTEXT updated).
- Document `manifest.db_project_id` as a **UUID** in `schemas/manifest.schema.json` (non-structural).
- Deferred config: Huxley `io/common` absolute prefix; Windows share name; per-machine fleet repo clone path.

## End every session with
What changed in CONTEXT.md, which ADRs were written, and the single next action.
